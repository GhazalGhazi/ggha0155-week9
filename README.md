Hey I am Ghazal and this is my week9 quiz.


# Part 1: Imaging Technique Inspiration

- De Stijl Movement and Mondrian’s Influence:

   - **De Stijl**, founded by Piet Mondrian and Theo van Doesburg, focuses on *geometric abstraction and grids*, using *primary colors* like red, blue, and yellow. These principles are evident in Mondrian’s "Broadway Boogie Woogie", with a structured grid and vibrant color blocks.
   - For my project, I will incorporate *De Stijl’s geometric grid structure and color palette* into a Pacman-style game, where the user can choose between different playgrounds inspired by various De Stijl artworks. The benefit of this approach is that it allows me to create diverse, visually engaging environments using basic shapes, while still maintaining a functional and interactive game.
